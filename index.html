        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my site. Here you can find the products of my labor over the 8 weeks of Expeditions in the 
        Computer Sciences class of 2015. These vary from projects suchs as developing the very site you're viewing, 
        to programming an artificial intelligence to fight for you in a battle royale.</p>
        <p>You can interact with the bar above in order to navigate the site. The "Home" button will bring you here, the homepage. 
        The "About Me" button will bring you to a page, as the name suggests, about me, detailing various information simply 
        about me. The "Hardware" page details various information about a computer's hardware and what it does. Doge Game 
        brings you to a game developed by myself and my partner, Albert. Finally, the Misc. Page will display even more links to 
        my other projects.</p>

        <h1>Overview of the Projects</h1>
        <p>The projects I've finished vary a lot. They go from things as simple as a calculator, to a game so great it's
        worthy of winning an award or something. Said projects consist of these:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Website project. This is what you're looking at now. A project to make something that serves as a hub where 
            you can find all the other projects.<br></li>
            <li>Calculator project. This served as an introduction to using basic javascript. We basically just had
            to make a calculator that could add, subtract, multiply, and divide. We could also add other functions too,
            like exponents and finding square roots.</li>
            <li>Team Name Generator. We could do anything for this one, so me and my partner, Jason, decided to make a random
            sports team name generator. Solidified my foundations in javascript and arrays a bit more.</li>
            <li>1988. A game made by a team of me, Max, and Justin where the goal was to figure out a four digit code derived
            from a set of clues. We never finished the content, but all the coding and function was finished and working
            properly.</li>
            <li>Doge Simulator 2015. This is the one I'm most proud of. I worked on it alongside Albert and the goal of this
            game was to achieve euphoria by buying certain items using dogecoins generated by playing with a doge. This one
            also strengthened my confidence with javascript a lot more than the other projects.</li>
            <li>Vindinium. This was our final project. We used a game called Vindinium which was made for battling using
            AI (Artificial Intelligence) and we each made our own bot to fight in an arena. This gave all the students
            at the least a basic foundation in how AIs work and furthermore gave us more practice with javascript.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So there you have it, those are all of the works you can find and explore in this site. Thanks for taking your time
        to look at my finished work. Enjoy!</p>
