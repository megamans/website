        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name's Ethan. I'm currently a Sophomore attending High School in Summit Shasta, as are most other students
        attending this Computer Sciences class. I'm a Chinese Christian, I've got a dog, and I love playing video games.
        Additionally I also enjoy watching anime on my free time (they're just Japanese cartoons for those who don't know)
        and various other TV shows.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="body">
        <h1>Games</h1>
        <p>So let's talk games. This is what takes up the majority of my free time, so why not? I'll start off with the
        fact that I grew up with Nintendo. I love their games, and haven't owned a system other than Nintendo's since the PS2.
        However I also play games on PC, for the games that I can't find on a Nintendo console. I'm very invested in my games
        and most of my time and effort goes into them.</p>
        <ul><b>Some of my favorite games include:</b>
            <li>Super Smash Bros Melee</li>
            <li>Pokemon Omega Ruby</li>
            <li>Skyrim</li>
            <li>Legend of Zelda: Link Between Worlds</li>
            <li>Disgaea: Hour of Darkness</li>
            <li>Kirby and the Amazing Mirror</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of course there's many others I enjoy, but these are my favorites. I also play both Melee and Omega Ruby on a 
        competetive level, which I thought might be worth mentioning since many people are surprised by the fact that
        these games can be played competetively.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="body">
        <h1>Dogs</h1>
        <p>I <i>love</i> dogs. They're just the best thing in the world. But I'm not an expert or anything in dogs, 
        I'm just an enthusiast who enjoys them. My dog is a breed many people seem to not know about, the cockapoo. He's
        a cockerspaniel and poodle mix, and he's the best. While I wish he'd be more like other dogs and be more playful,
        he still has his good moments. Another breed I'm interested in would be the Shiba Inu, a Japanese breed that represents
        the character that is doge. Doge also isn't the only reason I love them, they're just so darn cute.

        See? Anyway, a few other breeds I like are the Kuvasz and the Border Collie. So great. Dogs are so great. Wow.</p>

    <div id="body">
        <h1>Shows</h1>
        <p>Japanese cartoons, American cartoons, American live action shows, I watch that. Mostly the Japanese cartoons.
        Some of my favorite genres of these are action, supernatural, comedy, and mystery. Most of the American shows I watch
        are sitcoms, superhero shows, and certain cartoons. I also have favorites of these, in case you're wondering. My
        favorite anime is the Bakemonogatari series, my favorite sitcom is Community, my favorite superhero show is The Flash,
        and my favorite American cartoon is Spongebob Squarepants (not the new ones).</p>
