        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <p>HTML is a programming language mainly used for making everything that you're seeing right now. HTML is linked to other things
        like CSS and Javascript, both of which are other languages, to make the page function differently. CSS is used to easily make things
        look pretty, and Javascript is used to make things do things, like buttons.</p>
        <p>HTML is used for making things called divs, which are kind of like objects you place around the webpage. For example,
        this box you're looking at is a div, and this paragraph you're looking at is a div within a div. These are the basic blocks
        you can place around your page with HTML.</p>
        <p>CSS is used to style the divs mentioned above. Of course you can do it in HTML too, but it's much more of a hassle and
        not nearly as convenient and organized as CSS. Styles that can be added to a div include background color, text size, font family,
        text color, etc., the list goes on. CSS is how you make websites look beautiful.</p>
        <p>Javascript is used to make things function. You can make your site do math, make objects spin, and you can also make artificial
        intelligences think and act using Javascript. Certain parts of this site are highly dependent on its Javascript, namely the doge game.</p>
