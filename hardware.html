        <h1>Hardware</h1>
        <p>Hardware is what's inside of a computer. You could say they're the building blocks of a computer, and each part of it
        makes something work. Some of these are the motherboard, the RAM or physical memory, the CPU or processor, the hard
        drive, and the power supply. These are the essentials within a computer, but you'd probably also want have tools to
        interact with the computer, the peripherals. The essentials for these are the monitor, the keyboard, and the mouse.
        Click on the heading of each section to see a picture of the associated part.</p>

        <p>The motherboard looks intimidating, but if you think about it, it's basically just one weird looking power strip.
        You get the other parts of the computer, and you plug it in here, simple as that. What it does is link all the parts together
        to one central hub and gets them all to work together by telling itself what to do at the boot up of a computer.</p>

        <h1><a href="http://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/miT-SsCuLtvX_LnjfNf0Fnw.jpg">Processor</a></h1>
        <p>This little thing is the brain of the computer. It tells the rest of the parts what to do by gathering information
        and decoding it into actual actions. It's what makes your computer function.</p>

    <div id="body">
        <h1><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Laptop-hard-drive-exposed.jpg">Hard Drive</a></h1>
        <p>This is how the computer remembers things. It stores the information that the processor will later decode.
        Nothing really happens here, you just put store things in it and sometime later you'll take it out to use.</p>

        <h1><a href="http://images10.newegg.com/NeweggImage/ProductImageCompressAll300/A0ST_130287840029705082DEDku6RQEv.jpg">Physical Memory</a></h1>
        <p>A popular way of explaining the RAM (physical memory) is through a metaphor. Imagine the computer is an office,
        there's all the drawers and stuff with all your documents and files. But you can't really use your documents while it's
        laid vertically in a drawer, right? The drawers are the hard drive. When you take out the files and lay it down flat 
        on a desk to use, it in a way takes up more space than if you have it in your drawers. The desk is your RAM. You can't
        place too many things on it, else you can't use them all. Getting more RAM is akin to getting a larger desk in this
        situation.</p>

        <h1><a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81FJa00A3yL._SL1500_.jpg">Monitor</a></h1>
        <p>The monitor is pretty straightforward, it's how you see everything going on with your computer. Without it,
        everything in your computer is still functioning the same way, you just can't see it. </p>

        <h1><a href="http://googletech.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Wireless-Keyboard-and-Mouse-Combo-Kit-IMB-3606-.jpg">Keyboard & mouse</a></h1>
        <p>These tools allow you to interact with the computer. The mouse uses sensors on the bottom to sense where it's moving
        and moves the cursor on the monitor accordingly. The keyboard senses button inputs from the user to perform certain commands,
        these include just pressing buttons with letters on them to have the same letter appear on screen to inputting
        combinations to buttons to make your computer do something, like close a window. Basically, you can't really get your
        computer to do much without these.</p>
